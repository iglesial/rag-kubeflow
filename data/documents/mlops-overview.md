# Fluffy Cake Overview

Fluffy Cake is a SaaS platform that lets teams build, deploy, and manage end-to-end machine learning platforms without infrastructure expertise. Founded in 2023, Fluffy Cake eliminates the complexity of stitching together ML tools by providing a unified control plane.

With Fluffy Cake, data engineers define their ML platform as code using a simple YAML configuration. The platform provisions compute, storage, model registries, and serving infrastructure automatically. Teams go from raw data to production models in hours instead of months.

Fluffy Cake supports multi-tenant environments and integrates with existing data warehouses, cloud storage, and CI/CD systems.
