# package-1

Example Python package for Databricks

## Package Structure

This package follows a standard architecture managed by Projen:

- **`package_1/app.py`**: Contains the `App` class with the `run()` method
  - The `run()` method is the entry point for your application logic
  - All your business logic should be implemented here

- **`package_1/config.py`**: Defines configuration inputs using Pydantic
  - Declare input parameters here using Pydantic fields
  - CLI arguments and environment variables are automatically parsed
  - Example: `job_run_id: int = Field(description="Databricks job run ID")`

- **`package_1/main.py`**: Entry point (managed by Projen)
  - This file is automatically generated and should not be edited
  - It initializes the App and calls the `run()` method

## Getting Started

1. **Define your inputs** in `config.py`:
   ```python
   class Config(BaseSettings):
       job_run_id: int = Field(description="Databricks job run ID")
       data_path: str = Field(default="/data", description="Path to data")
   ```

2. **Implement your logic** in the `App.run()` method in `app.py`:
   ```python
   def run(self) -> None:
       print(f"Processing job {config.job_run_id}")
       # Your application logic here
   ```

3. **Run locally** using just:
   ```bash
   just run <job_run_id>
   ```

## Development

See the `justfile` for available commands:
- `just install-dev`: Install all dependencies
- `just test`: Run tests
- `just lint`: Run linter with auto-fix
- `just typecheck`: Run type checking
- `just check-all`: Run all checks

## Deployment

This package is deployed to Databricks as a wheel and executed as a Databricks job.
The entry point is configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.scripts]`.
